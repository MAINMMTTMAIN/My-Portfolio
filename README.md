## About Me

Hey! I'm **Mohammad Mahdi** (you can call me Mahdi or MMTT 😄), a passionate computer enthusiast who loves both **software** and **hardware**.  

I enjoy creating games, animations, tools, and anything that makes computers more fun or useful. This portfolio is my little corner to show what I've been building.

## Featured Projects

Here are some of the things I've worked on:

- **Snake Game** (Python + Tkinter)  
  Fully featured version with user login, leaderboard, dark/light mode toggle, custom snake colors, background music, score saving, and smooth gameplay.

- **2D Animations** (FlipaClip on Android)  
  Made when I was 17 – simple but fun: falling leaf, brick hitting the ground, human reaction animation.

- **MMTT Preview** (Adobe After Effects)  
  A short motion graphics teaser I designed.

- **3D Animation** (Adobe Character Animator)  
  Puppet-based 3D-style animation with my own sound design and editing.

- **SystemPulse** (Python)  
  Lightweight real-time system monitor that tracks CPU, RAM, battery, and GPU usage – clean and minimal.

I'd love to collaborate or hear your ideas — let's build something cool together! 🚀
